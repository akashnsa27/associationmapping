# One-to-One Association Mapping 

One-to-One Mapping
===================
Use Case:
One Student has one Address.
One Address belongs to only one Student 

1. @OneToOne
This annotation is used to map a one-to-one relationship between two entities.

2. @JoinColumn
Defines the foreign key column in the owning table (here: Student).
Student is the owning side of the relationship. The foreign key column address_id will be created in the student table

3. mappedBy
Indicates that the relationship is bidirectional and is mapped by the other entity.
This side is the inverse side (doesnâ€™t hold the foreign key).
No @JoinColumn here.

4. cascade = CascadeType.ALL: Any operation on Student (save/delete/update) will also apply to Address.

5. fetch = FetchType.EAGER: When we fetch a student, it will also fetch its associated address.
